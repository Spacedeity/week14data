# week14data
# Hi i choose the "netflix_titles" data set

# The intresting thing that i noticed was that the data was sorted according to the day a show was added and in descending  order too.

# Difficulties:
# It is difficult to  find shows that only have one season  available.
# The data should be sorted out  and categorized according to their genre.
# The data should also be sorted out if its a "movie/ tv show".
# One should also be able to search for movies pr shows in a specific coutry.
# The rating  should also be sorted out propery for easier searching by customers.

# week 15 assignment.
